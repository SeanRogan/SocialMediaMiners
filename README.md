# SocialMediaMiners
A collection of open source data mining scripts built to collect data on specified topics or keywords. Collect post information from Twitter, Reddit or Youtube. 

## Requirements
All scripts are designed to use a PostgreSQL database and Python 3.10. Posts are accessed via the offical APIs of the platforms, so you may have to sign up for an account and follow the instructions to gain API access. The API credentials you get from the platform will be needed to setup your private.py credentials file that each script requires.
