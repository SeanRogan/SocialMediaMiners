## DISCLAIMER: This repo will no longer be maintained. I do not think these will work now that reddit and twitter have changed their API policies. 

# SocialMediaMiners
A collection of open source data mining scripts built to collect data on specified topics or keywords. Collect post information from Twitter, Reddit, and coming soon.. Youtube. 

### API Links: 
Reddit

## Requirements
All scripts are designed to use a PostgreSQL database and Python 3.10. Posts are accessed via the offical APIs of the platforms, so you may have to sign up for an account and follow the instructions to gain API access. The API credentials you get from the platform will be needed to setup your private.py credentials file that each script requires.
